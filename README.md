# JS-audio-stream-player
A simple player for an audio stream written in javascript. Light and dark mode support, only for streaming audio. Uses xml parsing to get currently playing artist and song. Audio quality switch.
## How to use
Very simple to use, use the release .zip file without the screenshots and readme file. Currently has a working radio stream put in. Simply replace relevant links to your .mp3/other stream and put your logo in instead of the planets.
